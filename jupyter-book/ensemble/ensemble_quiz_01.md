```{admonition} Question

In the context of a classification problem, what are the differences between a
bagging classifier and a random forest classifier:

- a) in a random forest, the base model is always a decision tree
- b) in a random forest, the split threshold values are decided completely at
  random
- c) in a random forest, a random resampling is performed both over features
  as well as over samples
```
